                 Though not Wi-Fi itself, it laid the groundwork. The key player, Vic Hayes, is considered the "father of Wi-Fi" 
                 for his work on setting the standards in the late 1970s. The 1980s saw the FCC open up radio frequencies for   
                 unlicensed use, which companies jumped on. The need for a common language led to the IEEE 802.11 standards in 
                 1997, but it wasn't until catchy branding arrived in 1999 with "Wi-Fi" that things really took off. That same 
                 year, Wi-Fi got a major boost when Apple included it in their iBook laptops, making it a mainstream consumer 
                 feature. Since then, Wi-Fi has continued to evolve, offering faster speeds and wider ranges, forever changing
                 the way we connect to the world.""")
